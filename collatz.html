        <h2>About the Collatz Conjecture</h2>
        <p>The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, is a mathematical theory that applies to positive integers. It suggests that using the following steps will always lead to the number 1: if the number is even, divide it by 2; if the number is odd, triple it and add one. This process is repeated until the number reaches 1.</p>
